### CPSC 120

Lab 9

Lab 9, part 2 was my favorite because me and my partner had the most
fun trying to figure out how to print arrays as a list. It was fun
learning how to pull certain words that fit into a certain factor and 
try to put them into a seperate list by grabbing possible details
with existing functions.

Lab 11

Lab 11, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because it introduced
use to using code from functions and being able to return it from
a different file. We used class deinitions to define current states of the game. It helped showed how code builds on top of each other and that you can't just do everything in one file.

Lab 12

Lab 12, part 2 was my favorite because it helped me learn how to use
certain libraries such as Magick into our code and make it into an animation. We used "sin()" to help change colors of the animation so it switches from different channels smoothly. It was fun learning how code can make images manually than
just using an app to make a gif.
